1. I spent 3-4 days total, spread out over two weeks or so. Have been busy with work.

2. The most rewarding challenge was to implement oop and class methods and variables with Ruby. I've done this with other languages, but implementing in Ruby is new.

3. I added a zipcode field for the customer and a return method which allows a customer to return an item (and increments that items stock.)

4. The toughest part is always figuring out how classes should interface.
